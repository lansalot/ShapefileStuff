**Project Description**
Shapefile is a .NET library that supports read only enumeration of ESRI shapefiles, including any metadata. All 2D shapes are supported: Point, MultiPoint, PolyLine and Polygon. 

This library may be useful if you need to draw a set of shapes from a shapefile or convert the data to a different format.

See the [Documentation](Documentation) tab for a quick guide to getting started. The download contains debug and release DLLs, XML documentation and the current source code.
